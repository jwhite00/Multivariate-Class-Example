# Session 2: Visualizing Tabular data

### [Multivariate Case](https://github.com/EvansDataScience/VisualAnalytics_tabularDataMulti)

_____

We collect multiple variables for a particular purpose, knowing that social complexity can hardly be directly explained with bivariate or univariate approaches. 

However, as it is difficult to visualize information with high dimensional data; most of our data will go through some dimensionality reduction that will have a particular purpose:

1. [Descriptive](#part2)

2. [Inferential](#part3)

## Descriptive plots

The word descriptive is used because our intention is not to go beyond the units of analysis we have.

This time, I will use the [data about city safety](https://jpn.nec.com/en/global/ad/insite/download/economist/en/data_workbook_dl.html):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(openxlsx)
#load data 
link="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/data/raw/master/safeCitiesIndexAll.xlsx"
safe=read.xlsx(link)

#Descriptive Plugins
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)
library(ggrepel)

#Ineferential Plugins
library(dotwhisker)
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(cluster)
```


#data description (eventually drop)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#data description, variable labels
names(safe)
```

variables telling us information about the safety levels of cities in the world,  **D**_igital_, **H**_ealth_, **I**_nfrastructure_, and **P**_ersonal_ dimensions.

measures of actions taken (**In**), and results (**Out**). 

It is not a good idea to see the first rows, as there are too many variables. But we can use some tricky notation:

None of our previous plots represent **dimensionality reduction**, and that is what is coming now.

A first approach would be to use a technique called **PCA** (principal components analysis). This technique is usefull if you want to get a composite score and a ranking: 

2. Request one **factor** that summarize the _variables_, and the **score** for the _cases_.

You have here a way to produce scores and a ranking, then you can propose any plot from the univariate alternatives for measurements or ordinal classification. However, you must pay attention to the variables:

a. Realize you have a set of variables that tell you about measures taken (all the ... _IN_ ... ones) and outcomes (.. _OUT_ ..). Make two data frames:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
safeCopy=safe
resultPCA=principal(safeCopy[,-1], nfactors = 1, scores=T, normalize=T)
#get the new index
safeCopy$indexSafe=as.vector(factor.scores(safeCopy[,-1],resultPCA)$scores)

#rescale the index # pysch has its own 'rescale'
safeCopy$indexSafe=scales::rescale(safeCopy$indexSafe, to = c(1, 100)) 
safeCopy$RankSafe=rank(-safeCopy$indexSafe)

# IN/OUT
positionsIN=grep("_In_", colnames(safe) )
positionsOUT=grep("_Out_", colnames(safe) )

#
safeIN=safe[,c(1,positionsIN)]
safeOUT=safe[,c(1,positionsOUT)]

#get the rankings and composite indexes:
### IN
resultIN=principal(safeIN[,-1],
                   nfactors = 1,
                   scores=T,
                   normalize=T)

safeIN$indexSafeIN=as.vector(factor.scores(safeIN[,-1],resultIN)$scores)
safeIN$indexSafeIN=scales::rescale(safeIN$indexSafeIN, 
                                   to = c(1, 100)) 
safeIN$RankSafeIN=rank(-safeIN$indexSafeIN)
### OUT
resultOUT=principal(safeOUT[,-1],
                    nfactors = 1,
                    scores=T,
                    normalize=T)

safeOUT$indexSafeOUT=as.vector(factor.scores(safeOUT[,-1],resultOUT)$scores)
safeOUT$indexSafeOUT=scales::rescale(safeOUT$indexSafeOUT, 
                                     to = c(1, 100)) 
safeOUT$RankSafeOUT=rank(-safeOUT$indexSafeOUT)
#merge the results
safeIO=merge(safeIN,safeOUT)
set.seed(123)
distanceAmong <- dist(safe[,-1]) # euclidean distances between the rows
result <- cmdscale(distanceAmong,eig=TRUE, k=2) # k is the number of dim
# data frame prep:
dim1 <- result$points[,1]
dim2 <- result$points[,2]
coordinates=data.frame(dim1,dim2,city=safe$city)
# computing clusters
result <- kmeans(safeIO[,-c(1,25,26,53,54)], # not using composites just created
                 centers = 3) # how many clusters
# adding the cluster
safeIO$cluster=as.factor(result$cluster)
```



```{r }
base <- ggplot(safeIO, aes(x= indexSafeIN, y= indexSafeOUT,
                           label=city,
                           color = cluster)) # cluster!!
plot1 = base + geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) 

plot1 + geom_text_repel(na.rm=TRUE,size=2) 

```

## Inferential plots

In this situation, you are working with samples, and you use that information to inform about the population. Our main interest will be in **regression analysis**.



```{r }
#data prep
cut=median(safe2$PERSONAL)
safe2$PERSONAL_bi=ifelse(safe2$PERSONAL>cut,
                         1,0)
library(margins)
margins_logit_PERSONAL = margins(logit_PERSONAL) 
marginalSummary=summary(margins_logit_PERSONAL)
logit_PERSONAL = glm(PERSONAL_bi~ .,
                          data = safe2[,-c(1,5)],
                          family = "binomial")
digi=cplot(logit_PERSONAL, "HEALTH",draw = F)

#GGPLOT
base = ggplot(digi, aes(x = xvals)) 
p1= base + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
                       fill = "grey90")
p2 = p1 + geom_line(aes(y = yvals)) 
p3= p2 + labs(title="Effect of HEALTH index on PERSONAL index",
              x= "HEALTH", y="Predicted Value")
p3 + theme_bw()
```
